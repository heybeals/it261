I have never read the book, "Handmaid's Tale" written by Margaret Atwood. 
It is presently a miniseries on HULU, of which a lot of people are extremely excited about.
I'm sure they are looking forward to the 5th season of the award-winning "Handmaid's Tale"
I've heard that Elizabeth Moss' rendition as June is spot on and that my teacher liked the show's first 2 seasons!
