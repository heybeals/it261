<h2>About Me</h2>
<img class="right" src="images/BealsFam.png" alt="Me and my family">
    <p>I live and work in California, after relocating from Seattle two years ago. I currently work for a CA state agency in the IT division. I also run my own company as a business strategist and service designer. <br><br>My career initially began with brand strategy and identity + web design over a decade ago. As the industry evolved, so did I. I transferred from Seattle Central to UW where I graduated as a triple major with BA degrees in Communication, Humanities, and Social Science. I earned a Graphic Design certificate from Bellevue College <em>(at the time we were their beta group before the program was accredited)</em>. I also hold a UX certificate and constantly kick around the idea of going back to school for a MBA.<br><br>I'm a nearly 40yr old mom and wife, a lifelong learner, and avid reader who loves to refinish furniture, make elaborate crafts, and play strategic word games - mostly words with friends and wordle. At night when my kids are finally asleep, the hubs and I binge anime or I read past my bedtime.</p><br>
